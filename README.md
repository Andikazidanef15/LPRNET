# LPRNET

##Project Description

This is my implementation of the paper : https://arxiv.org/pdf/1806.10447.pdf
It is a **lightweight** model that can perform **real time** License Plate Recognition
with the help of deep neural networks.  

##This is a part of a complete Automatic Number Plate Recognition Pipeline which covers Plate Detection, Plate transformation and Plate Recognition. More details to follow on my blog.
